Entrepreneur: So how do you plan to pay me this time Mario? Credits, Jems, or loans like the one you still haven't paid back yet?
Mario: If you'd let me finish, I have your special Macguffin you asked me to get from that wreckage

Mario: Luigi, I might've made a small mistake. I was talking to this alien I found that said he knew how I could make my crew be in two places at once.
Mario: And well, he did make two of us, then four more, then sixteen, and now there's hundreds of us.
->(visible Confusion)
    Mario: Don't look at me like that, you know I wanted spend more time with Peach while running my lucrative trade business.
    Mario: Right now though I need you to send me some credits so I can solve this but don't worry I'll send you this cute little alien I found in a forest somewhere.
    ->Sure?
        <<addCredits -10>>

        <<nextTrade>>
    ->No thanks, Mario.
        Mario:Ok I'll ask Bowser then, he's been looking to meet up with me for some reason after I took Peach from him.
        <<nextTrade>>
->Mario, I'm not doing this. I don't know what you did or why there's a hundred of you but I don't want to know.
    Mario: Actually there's several hundred. But I understand.
