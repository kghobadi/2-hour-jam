Hungry Warlord: Do you have food? I'm getting hungry and some cheese should fix that.
Hungry Warlord: If not you could always pay me some gold or be destroyed.
Hungry Warlord: Up to you.

    Happy Warlord: Thanks! Here, take this salvage.
        <<generateItem salvage>>
->If I give you 5 gold would that be enough
    Unsatisfied Warlord: No but I'll take it anyways and let you go.
    <<addCredits -5>>
->Bother someone else.
    Hangry Warlord: NO, I'M GOING TO BOTHER YOU!!!
    ->Please don't I'd rather not destroy you.
